CSE 111 Proposal for a Student Chosen Program

    (This is a proposal. All proposals are written with our best
    knowledge at the beginning of a project. As we progress from the
    beginning to the end of a project, we gain more knowledge, and we
    change some of our proposed ideas. This is part of completing any
    project and is fine.  However, we still must write a proposal so
    that our teachers or supervisors know what we intend to do. Please
    answer each of the following questions to the best of your
    knowledge.)

1. What is the title of your program?
    Dice Roller

2. What real-world problem will your program address or help to solve?
    Rolling dice

3. What will you learn from developing this program?
    This program will help me learn how to incorporate the knowledge we've
    learned so far into using functions to accomplish a goal.

4. What Python modules will your program use?
    My program will use random and pytest

5. Will you separate your Python program into functions that each
perform a single task?
    Yes. In addition to test functions and main, my program will have 
    functions to get number of dice and number of sides on a die from the user,
    a function to get the value of a rolled die, and a function to get the total
    of all dice rolled.

6. Will you write test functions to test at least two of your program
functions?
    Yes. I will be able to write test functions for the function that gets the value 
    of a single rolled die and the function that gets the total of all dice rolled.

Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.
I learned a lot about functions this semester. I remember one time near the beginning of the
semester, I was having a hard time figuring out why we needed to use a main function to call
other functions. I was so used to just writing the code out brute force that it just didn't 
make sense. Then, as we started using the same function over and over in the same program, it 
started to click.


2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?
Test functions are invaluable. They are a quick, easy way to make sure a function is doing what
it is supposed to without having to run the whole program, putting inputs in each time.


3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?
If a program isn't working, I first try using print debug functions. They can help identify where 
the problems are. If that doesn't work, I use the built in "run and debug" ability Visual Code 
provides. Once I have identified and fixed a problem, I run the problem area through a test 
function if possible to make sure it is doing things right.
